you can plug the LED into a motor output instead of letting it be on
all the time.  this conservese onboard battery power and allows
differential light measurements, which are much more sensitive.  any
number of leds can be plugged into a single motor port.  the digital
outputs can also be used for this purpose, but we should recommend
that people come talk to paul if they want to do it that way.
